NEO-Sharp project is built using C# on top of .NET Core. C# is the programming language, while .NET Core is the default collection of classes that are ready for you to use.

C# can also be used with .NET Framework (different from .NET Core), but this is only compatible with Windows, and for that reason, .NET Core is used instead.
