NEO is the use of blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, the use of smart contracts for digital assets to be self-managed, to achieve "smart economy" with a distributed network.
Neo-sharp is a new core and node implementation of NEO with three main project goals:

* Break interdependencies in NEO and allow plug-able modular design to be used by node implementations;
* Create testing infrastructure for both specification behavior and benchmark of modifications;
* Develop a fully compatible version and new experimental high performance module for each component;
* This project is not about adding new features to NEO, itâ€™s about establishing and adhering coding best practices, implementing proper design patters and ensuring the code is testable with a focus on unit test code coverage.

The project runs on .NET Core and it's compatible with Windows, Linux and MacOS. This documentation is related to neo-sharp development, if you are looking for Smart Contract development, please refer [here](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/introduction.html).

## You are invited to contribute

Neo-sharp is community driven project, meaning that your contribution is more than welcome.
You can build new code, help with unit testing and improving this documentation. We are waiting for you in [Discord](https://discord.gg/umsfhqs) and [GitHub](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-sharp)!

The easiest way to find something to implement is to find an issue from GitHub or help us increasing the test coverage by adding new unit tests. You can check the current test coverage [here](https://codecov.io/gh/CityOfZion/neo-sharp/tree/master/src).

## Guides

This project aims to be accessible to all kind of people, so if you are new to development, please follow the [basic guide](basic_guide).

If you are an experienced developer but new to Blockchain, we recommend you to start from the [intermediate guide](intermediate_guide).

For those who are already used to Blockchain, you can go directly to the [advanced guide](advanced_guide).

[Best Patterns and Practices](best_practices) is recommended for all developers!

We suggest you reading the full documentation to understand how Blockchain and NEO works.
