Another goal of the neo-sharp team is to grow together and help everyone become better developers than when they started working on the project. We will continue to curate a list of resources on best patterns and practices, anti-patterns, bad habits, or any other quick reads that could be beneficial to increase the quality of code contributors of the project:

## General Coding Practices and Conventions:
Neo-sharp aims to adhere to Microsft C# .NET best practices and industry standard design patterns. Please reference the following resources and familiarize yourself with recommended best practices.

[C# Gettting Started](https://github.com/dotnet/training-tutorials/tree/master/content/csharp/getting-started) This resource was a good crash course on some of the basics in C# if you are new to the language or if you could use a quick refresher.

[C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) This is a quick resource to demonstrate code commenting, general formatting, and a quick overview.

[.NET Framework Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/) This is a comprehensive resource that enumerates everything from naming conventions, to proper exception handling, all the way to when to use certain collections and types.

[Patterns and Anti-patterns](https://github.com/dotnet/training-tutorials/blob/master/content/csharp/getting-started/patterns-antipatterns.md) This is a good overview of some of the more popular design patterns (and anti-patterns) with examples.

## Anti-patterns and bad habits

We've all done it at some point. Here you can find some links to resources on patterns and practices that could get you in trouble as a developer.

[9 Anti-patterns Every Programmer Should Be Aware Of](https://sahandsaba.com/nine-anti-patterns-every-programmer-should-be-aware-of-with-examples.html) This is a good quick list of some more general concepts that often hang developers and teams up from making good progress.

[Code Smells](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/) This was a nice concise list of some common code smells that developers will encounter.
