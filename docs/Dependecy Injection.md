Dependency Injection gives a project the flexibility add an replace code in a project. Since the code does not rely on a concrete implementation, but rather a Interface, it's much easier to replace a module when necessary.

If we use Interfaces in our projects, we already reduce the dependency between classes, 
But the problem is that somewhere in the code, you need to instantiate the concrete class, and if this is not done correctly, your classes will still depend on the concrete implementation.

The best way to avoid this high coupling scenario (the need of knowing the concrete class in advance), we add another actor that is responsible for instantiating the concrete classes, so the modules don't have any association with the concrete class, thus eliminating any dependency from one module from another.

We can resume Dependency Injection as the class/object responsible for managing the dependencies of other classes.

This promotes reusability, testability and maintainability of a project, because you no longer require concrete implementations, only Interfaces.

In neo-sharp, we use our own dependency injection mechanism, but most of the programming languages already have some sort of 'native' dependency injection.

In neo-sharp, the dependencies are inserted in the constructor of an object, and to this work, itâ€™s necessary to register the modules, so the DI class know which implementations are available for each interface.
